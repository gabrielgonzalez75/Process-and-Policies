# Resource Assignation Process

## Goals

     Resource assignation on Harvest projects is the primary action to assign resource to clients.

     To assign a resource into a project, we need the request from the product team, with the full detail 
       of skills and duration of the assignation.

### SLA

* Resources will  be assigned in the same day of the request.

### Harvest

* Harvest is the project tracking system.

## Prerequisites 

* The following information needs to be provided:
    * Assignation period with starts date and end date.
    * Skills required for the project.
    * Number of resources
    * Resource Department

## Validation

* Validate all resource information was provided before to assign resources into the project.
* Validate resource availability based on the requirements.
* If no resource available starts the hiring process or negotiate another resource base on the termination of other projects.
* Validate the resource utilization no more than 100%.
* Validate the resource is not assigned to another project on the same period of time unless the utilizations is 50% on each project.
*  Validate with Engineering Director the availability of the resource to assign into the project.

## Process

* Product Team request resources to be assign into a project.
* We review the availability of resources based on skills requested.
* If no resources available we can negotiate another resource base on the project termination or start hiring process.
* If a resource is available, we can assign into the project on Harvest.
* Validate the assignation period against the project duration.
* No resource could be assigned with more than 100% of utilization.
* Validate with Engineering and Product Directors the availability of the resource.
* Every project needs to have at least one engineer/designer and one PM or Technical lead.
* Validate if rate changes need to be applied base on the resource level.
