# Capture Harvest Timesheet Process

## Goals

Collect clients hours and recreation hours from all resources in the company.

### SLA

* Enter hours daily on Harvest 
* Friday end of day is the closing day for capture of weekly hours
* Monday morning before 9 am is the topmost to submit for approval.

### Harvest

* Harvest is the source system to capture timesheet 
* Harvest is used to create invoices to clients, using hours worked 

## Prerequisites 

* Resource must have a Harvest's account
* Resource must be assigned to an active project
*  The necessary task must be assigned before capture.

## Validation

* The team leader, Scrum master or project manager must validate hours on Monday morning.
* If is necessary we can request changes on hours captured by the resource.

## Capture Process

* Enter to Harvest Timesheets module
* Enter a new time entry
* Check the day you are capturing the hours
* Select project from the list
* Select the task type depending on your project assignation; billable or non-billable; kind of work performed.
* Assign a note to identify the time record, remember to use the format [Pivotal ID][Points]Comments
* If the project is using another tracking system, you need to use that history ID instead of Pivotal ID number.
* Start the timer (to collect time)
* Stop the timer when you finish the work
* If you are entering previous hours or manually entering, assign directly to the Time Box instead of start timer.
* Capture your hours daily
* On Friday by end of day you can submit for approval your timesheet
* Before to submit your timesheet please do a full review of hours and task.
* If you planned to work during the weekend, you can submit you timesheet on Monday morning before 9 am.
